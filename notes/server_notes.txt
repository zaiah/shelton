--by should help select criteria
--by u:zaiah or user
	
--where u:zaiah

	This is a great Lua candidate
	
x recreate / create the databases

add your clients
x	zaiah@ vokayent.com host (you can use an ip)
x	git @ vokayent.com
	
run a test
	make a folder or something, but run through the entire process
	add --by, --where, and other modifiers ( --at, --with)
	
after that works, move your other traps
	apache
	php
	mysql or postgresql

add sync option to config
	Get a database from some other server...

you should integrate pbr???
	or at least make one just for this sort of thing
